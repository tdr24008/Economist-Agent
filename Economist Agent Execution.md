# Economist Agent Execution

## PDF â†’ RAG Ingestion Workflow Implementation

This document describes the complete implementation of the PDF to RAG ingestion workflow for the Economist Agent system.

### **Setup Complete:**
- âœ… **Weaviate & Neo4j running**: Docker containers are healthy and ready
- âœ… **Dependencies installed**: weaviate-client, neo4j, all RAG components
- âœ… **PostgreSQL removed**: Simplified to Weaviate + Neo4j only

### **New Workflow:**
1. **Upload PDF** â†’ Streamlit file uploader
2. **Extract Text** â†’ PyPDF2 processes all pages
3. **Auto-Ingest** â†’ RAG pipeline chunks text and stores in:
   - **Weaviate**: Vector embeddings for semantic search
   - **Neo4j**: Knowledge graph with entities & relationships
4. **Search Ready** â†’ Your PDF content is now searchable through the RAG system

### **Key Features:**
- **Automatic chunking** with overlaps for better context
- **Entity extraction** to build knowledge graph relationships
- **Semantic embeddings** for similarity search
- **Success feedback** with chunk count confirmation
- **Fallback handling** if ingestion fails

### **Usage Instructions:**
1. Start the app: `streamlit run app.py`
2. Upload a PDF file
3. See "ðŸ”„ Ingesting PDF into RAG system..." spinner
4. Get confirmation: "âœ… PDF successfully ingested! Created X chunks"
5. Chat with agents - they can now search your PDF content!

### **Technical Implementation:**

#### **Database Architecture:**
- **Weaviate**: Vector database for semantic search (embeddings)
- **Neo4j**: Knowledge graph for entity relationships
- **No PostgreSQL**: Removed to simplify architecture

#### **RAG System Components:**
1. **Ingestion Pipeline**: Process documents â†’ chunks â†’ embeddings â†’ store in databases
2. **Retrieval System**: Search across all databases to find relevant information
3. **Generation Enhancement**: Use retrieved context to enhance LLM responses

#### **Modified Files:**
- `app.py`: Added `ingest_pdf_to_rag()` function and auto-ingestion on PDF upload
- `requirements.txt`: Removed `asyncpg`, added `weaviate-client` and `neo4j`
- `hybrid_rag_agent/requirements.txt`: Updated dependencies
- `docker-compose.yml`: Configured Weaviate and Neo4j services

#### **Docker Services:**
```yaml
services:
  weaviate:
    image: semitechnologies/weaviate:latest
    ports: ["8080:8080"]

  neo4j:
    image: neo4j:5-community
    ports: ["7474:7474", "7687:7687"]
```

#### **Ingestion Function:**
```python
async def ingest_pdf_to_rag(pdf_text: str, filename: str) -> bool:
    """
    Ingest PDF text into the RAG system (Weaviate + Neo4j).

    - Creates temporary markdown file with metadata
    - Configures chunking (1000 chars, 200 overlap)
    - Enables semantic chunking and entity extraction
    - Includes knowledge graph building
    - Returns success/failure status
    """
```

#### **Configuration:**
```python
config = IngestionConfig(
    chunk_size=1000,
    chunk_overlap=200,
    use_semantic_chunking=True,
    extract_entities=True,
    skip_graph_building=False  # Include knowledge graph
)
```

### **Current vs. Previous Workflow:**

#### **Previous (Local Only):**
- Upload PDF â†’ Extract text â†’ Save locally â†’ Agents analyze text directly

#### **Current (RAG Integrated):**
- Upload PDF â†’ Extract text â†’ **Ingest into Weaviate/Neo4j** â†’ Agents can:
  - Search PDF content semantically
  - Find relationships between entities in PDF
  - Retrieve relevant chunks when answering questions

### **Benefits:**
1. **Persistent Storage**: PDFs remain searchable across sessions
2. **Semantic Search**: Find content by meaning, not just keywords
3. **Entity Relationships**: Discover connections between concepts
4. **Contextual Retrieval**: Agents get relevant chunks for better responses
5. **Scalable**: Can handle multiple PDFs in the same knowledge base

### **Next Steps:**
The RAG system now automatically ingests any uploaded PDF into both vector and graph databases, making it searchable through semantic queries and entity relationships. Your uploaded documents become part of the searchable knowledge base instantly!

### **Troubleshooting:**
- Ensure Docker containers are running: `docker ps`
- Check Weaviate health: `curl http://localhost:8080/v1/meta`
- Check Neo4j browser: http://localhost:7474
- View container logs: `docker logs <container_name>`
