name: "Hybrid RAG Agent PRP"
description: "Comprehensive PRP for building an intelligent AI assistant that combines traditional RAG with knowledge graph capabilities using PostgreSQL pgvector and Neo4j Graphiti"
---

## Purpose

Build an intelligent AI assistant that combines traditional RAG with knowledge graph capabilities to provide comprehensive insights. The agent leverages vector similarity search via PostgreSQL with pgvector, hybrid search combining semantic and keyword matching with TSVector in PostgreSQL, and relationship-based reasoning through Neo4j with Graphiti. This creates a powerful multi-layered search system that understands semantic content, keyword relevance, and entity relationships for superior information retrieval and analysis.

## Core Principles

1. **Pydantic AI Best Practices**: Deep integration with Pydantic AI patterns for agent creation, tools, and structured outputs following main_agent_reference
2. **Type Safety First**: Leverage Pydantic AI's type-safe design and Pydantic validation throughout the hybrid search system
3. **Multi-Modal Search Integration**: Seamlessly combine vector, keyword, and graph search capabilities for comprehensive information retrieval
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Use TestModel and FunctionModel for thorough agent validation before deployment

## ⚠️ Implementation Guidelines: Don't Over-Engineer

**IMPORTANT**: Keep your agent implementation focused and practical for hybrid RAG functionality.

- ✅ **Start with core search capabilities** - Vector search, hybrid search, graph search as minimal viable tools
- ✅ **Copy existing RAG infrastructure** - Use examples/rag_pipeline as foundation, don't rebuild
- ✅ **Follow main_agent_reference** - Use proven Pydantic AI patterns for configuration and providers
- ✅ **Default to string output** - Only add result_type for specific structured outputs when needed
- ✅ **Test incrementally** - Use TestModel to validate each search capability as you build

### Key Question:
**"Does this search feature help the agent provide better, more accurate information retrieval?"**

If the answer is no, don't build it. Focus on the core hybrid RAG capabilities that make information retrieval more powerful.

---

## Goal

Create a hybrid RAG agent that provides superior information retrieval by combining three complementary search approaches:
1. **Vector search** for semantic similarity across document chunks
2. **Hybrid search** combining vector similarity with PostgreSQL full-text search (TSVector)
3. **Graph search** for entity relationships and temporal reasoning via Neo4j with Graphiti

The agent should offer a simple CLI interface and provide comprehensive, well-sourced answers by leveraging the strengths of each search method.

## Why

Traditional RAG systems using only vector search miss important information that could be found through keyword matching or entity relationships. By combining vector similarity (semantic understanding), keyword search (TSVector), and knowledge graph traversal (Neo4j), the agent provides:

- **Better recall** - Finding relevant information missed by any single search method
- **Contextual understanding** - Leveraging entity relationships for deeper insights  
- **Temporal awareness** - Understanding when facts were true and how relationships changed
- **Explainable results** - Clear source attribution and relationship reasoning

## What

### Agent Type Classification
- [x] **Tool-Enabled Agent**: Agent with multiple search tool integration capabilities
- [x] **Workflow Agent**: Multi-step search processing combining different retrieval methods
- [ ] **Chat Agent**: Conversational interface with memory and context
- [ ] **Structured Output Agent**: Complex data validation and formatting

### External Integrations
- [x] **Database connections**: PostgreSQL with pgvector and TSVector for hybrid search
- [x] **Graph database**: Neo4j with Graphiti for entity relationships and temporal reasoning
- [x] **Embedding API**: OpenAI-compatible embedding generation for vector search
- [ ] **REST API integrations**: None required for core functionality
- [ ] **File system operations**: Document ingestion handled by existing pipeline
- [ ] **Web scraping**: Not required for initial implementation

### Success Criteria
- [x] Agent successfully combines vector, hybrid, and graph search results
- [x] All search tools work correctly with proper error handling and fallbacks
- [x] Search results include proper source attribution and confidence scores

### Key Structure Principles

1. **Hybrid Approach**: Combines existing RAG infrastructure (`sql/`, `utils/`, `ingestion/`) with new Pydantic AI agent (`agent.py`, `settings.py`, `providers.py`)

2. **Pydantic AI Patterns**: Follows `main_agent_reference` structure for configuration, model providers, and CLI interface

3. **Separation of Concerns**: 
   - `agent.py`: Pure agent definition with search tools
   - `utils/`: Database and graph operations (reusable functions)
   - `settings.py`: Environment-based configuration
   - `providers.py`: Model abstraction layer

4. **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive test coverage with TestModel validation and real database integration tests

5. **Documentation**: Clear README with setup instructions, environment configuration, and usage examples

### Agent Implementation Plan

```yaml
Implementation Task 1 - Project Setup and Infrastructure:
  COPY existing RAG infrastructure:
    - cp -r examples/rag_pipeline/* ./hybrid_rag_agent/
    - Keep directory structure: sql/, utils/, ingestion/, documents/
    - Preserve database schema and utility functions
  
  CREATE agent structure following main_agent_reference:
    - settings.py: Environment configuration for database, graph, LLM, embedding APIs
    - providers.py: get_llm_model() function for model abstraction
    - dependencies.py: SearchDependencies dataclass for database connections
    - agent.py: Hybrid RAG agent definition with search tools
    - cli.py: Conversational interface for agent interaction

Implementation Task 2 - Agent Core Development:
  IMPLEMENT hybrid_rag_agent.py:
    - Import get_llm_model() from providers for model configuration
    - Create SearchDependencies dataclass with database connections
    - Define comprehensive system prompt for hybrid RAG capabilities
    - Agent definition: Agent(get_llm_model(), deps_type=SearchDependencies, system_prompt=SYSTEM_PROMPT)
    - NO result_type needed - default string output for conversational responses

Implementation Task 3 - Search Tool Integration:
  DEVELOP search tools in agent.py:
    tool_vector_search:
      decorator: "@agent.tool"
      signature: "vector_search(ctx: RunContext[SearchDependencies], query: str, limit: int = 10)"
      implementation: "Use db_utils.vector_search with embedding generation"
      error_handling: "Try/catch with fallback message on failure"
    
    tool_hybrid_search:  
      decorator: "@agent.tool"
      signature: "hybrid_search(ctx: RunContext[SearchDependencies], query: str, limit: int = 10, text_weight: float = 0.3)"
      implementation: "Use db_utils.hybrid_search with embedding + text search"
      validation: "Ensure text_weight between 0.0 and 1.0, limit between 1 and 20"
    
    tool_graph_search:
      decorator: "@agent.tool" 
      signature: "graph_search(ctx: RunContext[SearchDependencies], query: str)"
      implementation: "Use graph_utils.search_knowledge_graph"

test -d hybrid_rag_agent/sql && echo "SQL schema present"
test -d hybrid_rag_agent/utils && echo "Database utilities present"
test -f hybrid_rag_agent/utils/db_utils.py && echo "PostgreSQL utilities present"

grep -q "from pydantic_ai import Agent" hybrid_rag_agent/agent.py
grep -q "@agent.tool" hybrid_rag_agent/agent.py
grep -q "RunContext\[SearchDependencies\]" hybrid_rag_agent/agent.py

# Expected: Complete infrastructure with agent structure
# If missing: Copy missing components and create agent structure
```

### Level 2: Search Tool Validation (Mock Mode - No Credentials Required)

```bash
# Test agent creation with MockSearchDependencies
python -c "

### Level 4: Full Agent Validation (Mock Mode)

```bash
# Run test suite in mock mode (no credentials required)

python -m pytest tests/ -v --mock-mode

# Test specific search capabilities with mocks

python -m pytest tests/test_search_tools.py::test_graph_search_mock -v
python -m pytest tests/test_agent_integration.py::test_comprehensive_search_mock -v

# Test CLI interface in mock mode
python cli.py --mock-mode
# Should show: "Running in MOCK MODE - no real database connections"
# Should accept queries and return mock search results

# Test agent conversation flow with mocks
python -c "
from hybrid_rag_agent.agent import hybrid_rag_agent
from hybrid_rag_agent.dependencies import MockSearchDependencies
from pydantic_ai.models.test import TestModel

mock_deps = MockSearchDependencies()
test_model = TestModel()

    # Test multi-turn conversation
    queries = [
        'What is machine learning?',
        'How does it relate to artificial intelligence?', 
        'Find documents about neural networks'

    for i, query in enumerate(queries):
        result = hybrid_rag_agent.run_sync(query, deps=mock_deps)
        print(f'Turn {i+1}: {query} -> Success: {len(result.output) > 0}')

print('Mock conversation flow working')

# Expected: All mock tests pass, CLI works in mock mode, conversation flow functional
# If failing: Complete mock implementations and ensure realistic sample data
```

## Final Validation Checklist

### Hybrid RAG Agent Implementation Completeness (Mock Mode Priority)

**Phase 1 - Mock Development (No Credentials Required):**
- [ ] Complete agent project structure: `agent.py`, `settings.py`, `providers.py`, `dependencies.py`, `cli.py`
- [ ] All RAG infrastructure copied from examples/rag_pipeline with mock support
- [ ] MockSearchDependencies with realistic sample data generators
- [ ] Agent instantiation with graceful credential fallback to mock mode
- [ ] All 8 search tools registered: vector_search, hybrid_search, graph_search, perform_comprehensive_search, get_document, list_documents, get_entity_relationships, get_entity_timeline  
- [ ] Search tools work with MockSearchDependencies (no real database required)
- [ ] CLI interface supports --mock-mode flag for development
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite with TestModel + MockSearchDependencies validation

- [ ] Search result deduplication and source attribution implemented
- [ ] Real database integration tests passing
- [ ] Production-ready configuration validation

### Pydantic AI Best Practices

- [ ] Type safety with RunContext[SearchDependencies] throughout all tools

- [ ] Error handling: graceful fallbacks when search methods fail
- [ ] Async patterns consistent: await all database operations
- [ ] Documentation: clear tool descriptions and parameter validation
- [ ] Performance: search response times under 2 seconds for typical queries

### Hybrid RAG Search Quality

- [ ] Vector search: semantic similarity working with pgvector functions
- [ ] Hybrid search: balanced semantic + keyword retrieval with configurable text_weight
- [ ] Graph search: entity relationships and temporal reasoning via Graphiti
- [ ] Comprehensive search: parallel execution with result combination
- [ ] Source attribution: clear document references and chunk citations
- [ ] Search intelligence: agent chooses appropriate search methods based on query type

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Hybrid RAG Agent Development

- ❌ Don't rebuild existing infrastructure - copy and adapt examples/rag_pipeline
- ❌ Don't skip database connection testing - verify PostgreSQL and Neo4j work before agent testing
- ❌ Don't ignore search result quality - test with real queries and validate relevance
- ❌ Don't skip error handling - implement graceful fallbacks when search methods fail
- ❌ Don't hardcode search parameters - make limits, weights, and preferences configurable

### Pydantic AI Integration  

- ❌ Don't skip TestModel validation - test each search tool individually during development
- ❌ Don't hardcode database connections - use dependency injection through SearchDependencies
- ❌ Don't ignore async patterns - use async throughout for database and graph operations
- ❌ Don't skip input validation - validate search queries, limits, and parameters
- ❌ Don't forget source attribution - always include document and chunk references

### Database and Search Integration

- ❌ Don't mix embedding dimensions - ensure consistency between database schema and embedding API
- ❌ Don't ignore connection pooling - use asyncpg pools for PostgreSQL, proper Neo4j management
- ❌ Don't skip result deduplication - combine search results properly without duplicates
- ❌ Don't ignore search performance - optimize queries and implement proper indexing
- ❌ Don't skip graph initialization - ensure Neo4j/Graphiti properly set up with indices and constraints
